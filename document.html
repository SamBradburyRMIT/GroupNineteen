originally moved from Perth. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">In Perth I studied a Bachelor of Commerce and have worked in the hospitality industry for almost 10 years - I currently work as a function and event sales coordinator. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">I play piano and have been in a number of bands all my life including a 12-piece big band and currently a 5-piece cover band playing all kinds of events and venues.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The industry of IT is constantly evolving and becoming a bigger part of our lives. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">We are becoming more reliant on technology to keep us connected, do our jobs and be entertained. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">My interest in this field is in the area of security and how we can protect our information from those who want to take advantage of our rising reliance on technology.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ve always been interested in computers and using technology in my own life. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">From something as simple as an electronic calendar to building miniature robots (from a step-by-step box!). </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ve chosen RMIT because of its great reputation in this field as well as being able to study online &ndash; another great aspect of our current age of technology. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">From my studies, I expect to learn the fundamentals of the industry to allow me to get a job in my field of interest where I can continue to learn.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_7ch55gf5j5eu-2" start="2"><li class="c6 c13"><span class="c5">Sam B</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c2">I am currently completing my Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT via Open Universities Australia.<br>I am working full time as a warehouse storeperson for PC Case Gear. Have interests in things such as working with computers (building and upgrading) PC games, tabletop wargames such as Warhammer 40k and also enjoy playing guitar.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">In an ideal scenario, I would like to run my own development company, building and maintaining websites and software. This is very idealistic and difficult to achieve, I will need much more knowledge and experience to achieve this and this degree is my beginning to this.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">I have always worked in physical roles all my working life and as I start to get older my body is starting to let me down. I have always be a natural when it comes to technology with very little instruction and training. I have always found solutions and pathways where others would not. IT in general interests me a great deal and can see it being a great option for myself to support my family.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Avenues that I would need to take to reach my goals will include working in the industry. Jobs such as Front end developer or Database Administrator are the kinds of jobs that would put me in good stead to gain the knowledge of the industry</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Started a degree years ago at a different uni that was a double degree in Game Design and Computer Science. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Had to put that aside to go back to work full time. But I do have experience now in some programming and coding theory.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_7ch55gf5j5eu-2" start="3"><li class="c6 c13"><span class="c5">Cameron</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c2">I was born at my home in Buderim in QLD, I have grown up my whole life on the sunshine coast and went to school to both Kuluin state school in Kuluin and also St Johns College in Nambour in which I completed grade 12, over the years I have had many pets, but one of my most favourite is the pet I currently own with my partner as it is a nice big Oscar fish called Wesley which will bite your finger off if you put your finger in his water!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Although my main interest currently is focused on the financial industry, IT does play a large part of how the industry functions, in an expanding and ever growing technological era, knowing how IT affects and promotes not only an individual business but also entire markets is paramount, this is why I have chosen RMIT to study for an IT course, I believe that by the time I finish this course, I will have a much better understanding on how IT can affect my future.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_7ch55gf5j5eu-2" start="4"><li class="c6 c13"><span class="c5">Tim</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c2">My interest was first piqued when I was 5, watching my older brother (who was 7) build websites using HTML on a platform called Matmice. From simple beginnings like learning how to hyperlink and setting the favicon, to designing templates in MS Paint and embedding flash games from other websites we both had a lot of fun learning the early web together.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">This was not always going or be the case however, as my interest in web development would soon be consumed by sports and music, hence IT was on the backbench. As for the next number of years, when I wasn&rsquo;t playing sport or music, my interest in IT swayed more towards video games and setting up servers from unused PCs for friends to play on (mainly Source Engine games).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Having never delved too much in to the actual code and software side of things, it wasn&rsquo;t until I was in the tail end of my Chemical Engineering degree that I developed an affinity for programming, somehow finding myself in the world of .NET and C#. More recently, my interests have been overtaken by the strange and wacky domain of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Undertaking a Bachelor of IT felt very natural to me, for a newly kindled interest in IT and programming left me wanting more in terms of an education, and RMIT was a logical choice I was already in my final year of Chemical Engineering with RMIT. My expectations of this course are to hone in on the skills I have taught myself in my spare time, learn what skills I would need to develop to sustain a career in IT, and to gain the ability to adapt to the ever-changing landscape that is modern software and technology.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_7ch55gf5j5eu-2" start="5"><li class="c6 c13"><span class="c5">Austin</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c2">My name is Austin, I am 19 years of Age and currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology to broaden my understanding and add additional documentation to extend my resume, in hopes of expanding my career beyond Desktop Support. I chose RMIT as i see it as a much more reputable university than VU, which i had to move on from as i was offered this permanent position at Western Health and they had no IT related courses that I could take at night or in my spare time Online. I hope in my time in this course i have the ability to learn many Database related systems and that I can expand this into using it in the real world in the workforce.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_7ch55gf5j5eu-2" start="6"><li class="c6 c13"><span class="c5">Sam J</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c2">As a team, our personalities are a broad mix, there will be &nbsp;no clashes in the way in which we will learn due to the personality types with Mediator personalities working hand in hand with all other personalities as they have no interest in having power over others, also, the learning styles will fit hand in hand, the majority of the learning styles is tactile learning however there is a few members which are auditory learners, what this means is that whether the task involves sitting down and practically learning or listening while multitasking, there will be a strong amount of people in the group who will pick up on the information and share it accordingly.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The third test that was taken was more so of an extra test, in this test, the creativity and reasoning of each person was tested, in this area it is clear to see that each person is very different, however due to the other personality and learning traits, there will be no problems in people with more expertise and creativity helping those who do not know the way or are struggling to come up with ideas.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_7ch55gf5j5eu-1" start="2"><li class="c6 c35"><span class="c5">Group Processes</span></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Our group worked well together on the second assignment, everyone was willing to contribute and delegation of tasks worked well. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">We found that due to only having online communication responses were delayed. For this assignment we&rsquo;ll be working on this by improving our communication, having designated &lsquo;team meetings&rsquo; so that everyone can discuss ideas at one time.

There is however over a few outliers of the group, Including Cameron who wishes to become a Financial Planner, this job is in a completely different direction to the other members of the group who wish to pursue a job in the IT industry as it is in the Financial industry and the job focuses on helping people from all different backgrounds reaching their financial goals, however in times where technology is growing at a rapid pace, you need to be able to adapt to any changes otherwise you will be at risk of falling behind the competition who can implement various types of IT to their advantage.

This is something that many other competitors for the Raspberry Pi cannot do. Currently on the market there are DIY Projects that feature a temperature sensor, but lack complex readings. For example, it is common to find these to only feature an LED light and Piezo modules that indicate basic understanding (for example, the fridge temperature is &gt;30 degrees Celsius, it will make a noise) but this does not feature in depth analysis of temperature including exact temperature and any visual readings aside from an LED light.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_7ch55gf5j5eu-1" start="2"><li class="c11"><h3 id="h.8berxh6ubqo4" style="display:inline"><span class="c15">Detailed Description</span></h3></li></ol><ol class="c0 lst-kix_7ch55gf5j5eu-2 start" start="1"><li class="c19 c13"><h4 id="h.djio363erd4f" style="display:inline"><span class="c17">Aims</span></h4></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c2">We were approached by researchers at Monash University to address a problem of currently having issues with their freezers and fridges fluctuating in temperatures and the researches not being notified in time. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Current wireless lab monitoring equipment can cost upwards of $1,800 for a single monitor, an expense that can prohibit access for smaller laboratories. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The laboratory that we will base our model on requires monitoring for twenty-six temperature sensitive pieces of equipment across seven different lab spaces. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">The aim of this project is to develop a low-cost solution for temperature monitoring across the lab, safeguarding important samples as well as proving a more costly solution to this problem with a user-friendly interface. </span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_7ch55gf5j5eu-2" start="2"><li class="c19 c13"><h4 id="h.djio363erd4f-3" style="display:inline"><span class="c17">Plans and Progress</span></h4></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c12">Our technology will be able to detect fluctuations in temperature inside fridges and cool rooms.

It will be an efficient and cheap alternative to the expensive competitors already on the market. This idea was created by a few of us in a discord chat directly after the first weekly Collaborate Ultra session. We all decided we wanted to work with the raspberry pi technology and this idea was nominated as the best avenue to take to learn more about said tech. Glenn used his connections to set up a collaboration with Monash university in the Obstetrics and </span><span class="c12 c29">Gynaecology </span><span class="c12">Department which means we now have access to multiple fridges and freezers to test our product. Whilst all this was being organized Glenn also attended a seminar dedicated to the raspberry pi, he learned a bit more about their functions and capabilities whilst the rest of us have been doing research on them as well. We are planning to buy a few of them within the next week to get started. We have decided to use a simple thermometer (ds18b20 temp sensor) within each of the Fridges/Freezers that is connected to a raspberry pi 3 via a single cable. We will be using the python to program them, luckily some of us are also studying intro to programming so learning the new syntax should be relatively straight forward. &nbsp;</span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_7ch55gf5j5eu-2" start="3"><li class="c19 c13"><h4 id="h.djio363erd4f-4" style="display:inline"><span>Roles</span></h4></li></ol><p class="c6"><span class="c2">There will be four different roles utilized in the completion of this project.</span></p><p class="c6 c36"><span class="c2">&middot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><ul class="c0 lst-kix_3wzgntb9v639-0 start"><li class="c6 c22"><span class="c2">The technical designer will take the project idea and turn it into a functioning product.
