							<p style="color: black;">The ideal jobs of this group are actually quite similar, both Sam J and Glenn have the ideal job of becoming a security analyst and Sam B and Tim both wishing to become stack developers, this is interesting as it shows that these people have a common goal in mind and will essentially work better together as they know what they want, the difference in these two types of jobs however is quite large, a security analyst will look into protecting a company through implementing different types of software which will recognise potentials threat to that business and be able to protect their information whereas a stack developer is somebody who can develop the entire system pipeline, these would include databases, servers and involve system engineering. There is however over a few outliers of the group, Including Cameron who wishes to become a Financial Planner, this job is in a completely different direction to the other members of the group who wish to pursue a job in the IT industry as it is in the Financial industry and the job focuses on helping people from all different backgrounds reaching their financial goals, however in times where technology is growing at a rapid pace, you need to be able to adapt to any changes otherwise you will be at risk of falling behind the competition who can implement various types of IT to their advantage. As a whole the group definitely has different pathways which they wish to travel down with completely different industries however the group all has a common interest in understanding and learning more about technology as in today’s age, it is very important to keep up.</p>
